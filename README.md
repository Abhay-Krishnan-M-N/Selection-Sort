# Selection-Sort
Implementation of sorting algorithms- selection sort

Input: Array a

Output: Array a

Data Structure: Selection sort

Algorithm:
 
Step 1. Start
 
Step 2. Array a[10] is initialized
 
Step 3. Value of n is obtained from the user for the number of elements to be inserted
 
Step 4. Value of elements in array a is obtained from the user using for loop
 
Step 5. Value of idx is assigned as 0
 
Step 6. For loop with initial value of i being 0 & increasing till value not becoming n-1
 
  Step 6.1. For loop with initial value of j being i+1 & increasing till value not becoming n
     
   Step 6.1.1. If value of a[j] is less than a[idx]
      
    Step 6.1.1.1. Assign value of j to variable idx
     
   Step 6.1.2. Swap values of a[j] and a[idx] using another variable temp
 
Step 7. For loop with initial value of i being 0 & increasing till value not becoming n
   
  Step 7.1. Print value of a[i]
 
Step 8. Stop
